# Surfing the Bitcoin Waves: Comprehensive Trend Forecasting with Various Trader Types

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for "Surfing the Bitcoin Waves: Comprehensive Trend Forecasting with Various Trader Types". This project aims to analyze the impact of different types of traders on Bitcoin's market trends using advanced time-series forecasting techniques.

## Abstract

Cryptocurrency trading has gained immense popularity, with many traders seeking to emulate the strategies of successful investors, automated bots, or whale traders. This study investigates the effectiveness of such strategies and the impact of various trader types on the Bitcoin market. By employing a range of forecasting models, including machine learning, deep learning, and traditional time-series methods, we aim to provide insights that can help traders make informed decisions.

## Introduction

This project explores the dynamics of Bitcoin trading by classifying traders into various types and examining how these classifications influence market trends. We use historical data to build predictive models and evaluate their performance in forecasting Bitcoin prices.

## Methodology

Our methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering historical Bitcoin price data and trader activity.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
3. **Model Development:** Implementing various forecasting models.
4. **Evaluation:** Comparing model performance using standard metrics.

## Data

The dataset includes:
- Historical Bitcoin prices.
- Trading volumes.
- Indicators of trader activity.

## Models

We employ a variety of models, including:
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- **Deep Learning Models:** LSTM, RNN.
- **Traditional Time-Series Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA.

## Results

Our results indicate that certain trader types have a promising impact on market trends.  However traditional features such as open, close, high and low prices for prior timesteps still impacts model much more.

## Conclusion

This study highlights the importance of understanding trader behavior in the cryptocurrency market. By leveraging advanced forecasting techniques, traders can potentially improve their investment strategies and outcomes.
